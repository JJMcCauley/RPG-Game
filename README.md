test for jrpg combat engine (note, this is a WIP in progress and bugs are likely to be encountered)

An in development dragon quest style game done completely in HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript. Currently the name of the party can be decided or a default party can be selected. Afterwards it goes directly into a battle against a random group of 1-3 enemies. The player can attack the enemies and lower their hit points until they are defeated which will earn the party gold and experience. After a battle another random battle can be generated.
